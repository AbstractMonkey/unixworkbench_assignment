    and has the following behavior:

   - [x] When the program starts the user is asked how many files are in the current directory, and is then prompted to guess

   - [x] If the user's answer is incorrect, they are advised whether their guess is too low or too high and are prompted to guess again

   - [x] If the user guesses correctly, they are congratulated and the program ends

   - [x] The program doesn't end until the user has entered the correct number of files in the current directory

   - [x] The program is run by entering <i>bash guessinggame.sh</i> into the console

2) <b>A makefile</b>.

3) A markdown file called <b>README.md</b>, <i>which is entirely generated by the project's makefile!</i>
